APP DESCRIPTION
“Culinio” is an android application that allows the employees of a particular company to pre-schedule and order their meal. To use this application a particular company needs to register in our app. There will be 3 logins separately for the Employees, Chef, and the Organization. When logged into their respective login they will be able to access different views of the application. Right after the organization registration a unique “4 digit code” will be generated for that particular organization. This 4 digit code provides encrypted communication within the organization so that each employee is made sure that his/her order is sent only to his/her company’s cafeteria.

ORGANIZATION LOGIN:
When a particular organization logs into our application they need to provide the organization's email address and password. 
●	They will be able to add the menu items of their cafeteria and the chef details who will be handling all the orders in their office cafeteria.
●	 On the top right corner, the unique 4 digit code generated for this particular organization will be displayed. The code can be copied by clicking it. 
●	4 categories will be available to upload the menu items. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, and beverages/snacks are the categories available. While entering the menu items they need to provide the name, price, and a short description of that item. They will also upload an image of that item. They can upload the menu items in the respective category. 
●	They will also be provided an option to edit and delete the particular menu item. By clicking a particular menu item they will be redirected to a page where the option to edit and delete will be available.
●	They can add the chef details by clicking the button “Chef Details”. While entering the Chef details they will be providing the Chef’s name, email address, and password. They will also be able to delete a particular chef’s details.

EMPLOYEE LOGIN:
When a particular employee of a company logs into our app they need to provide his name, official email address, and the unique 4 digit code shared by the company. 
●	In the “Employee” login, the menu items available in the office cafeteria are displayed according to the category. 
●	For each category, the orders will be available only for a stipulated amount of time. For breakfast, the orders will be taken only from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. Similarly, for lunch, the timing will be 12 noon to 3 p.m, dinner from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. But for the beverages and snacks, there will be no time limit.
●	 The employee will be provided two options while ordering the food. Either he can schedule the meal for later or order it immediately. By clicking the “Schedule order” button he can schedule a meal for later where he/she will be asked for a time in which they wish to order their meal. And by clicking the “Place order now” button the order will be placed immediately. 
●	If the employee wishes to schedule all his/her meals for the day, they can click the schedule order button in all the categories. 
●	All the orders that a particular person has scheduled will be available inside the “Cup symbol” available on the main screen. In that screen, they will be provided an option to delete a particular meal if needed. 
●	As already mentioned each category will be available only for a particular time. If that time limit is passed, further orders will not be taken from that category of the menu. But during the time limit of each category both the options i.e., “Schedule order” and “Place order now” will be available.

CHEF LOGIN:
When the Chef logs into the app he needs to provide his/her official email address, password, and the unique 4 digit code. 
●	In the “Chef” login, the scheduled orders of the employees will be displayed on the screen. 
●	For each order, when the chef finishes preparing the food he/she will tick the check box provided right next to the order. Once the chef ticks the order, the corresponding employee will be getting a notification along with an alarm saying that his/her “Order is ready to take”. 
The employee can turn off the notification alarm either by clicking it and he will be redirected to a page with the “Dismiss” option. Or he can turn off the alarm by swiping it. This alarm indicates the order is readily available at the cafeteria counter.
