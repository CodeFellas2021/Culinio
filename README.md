#_Concept_

## _Introduction_
Our application "Culinio" is a service-based application for food ordering within a company. The Corporate world is known to toil hard at work even without breaks. A meal break is supposed to be very essential for a being to keep him/her fit and healthy. But, almost every corporate worker forgets to take their meal at the right time. They don't forget to eat but are too busy to remember to take their meal. Sacrificing one’s meal isn’t a healthy way to go ahead in a corporate world. Some employees don't move from their desk just for the sake of taking their meal from the Office Cafeteria. That’s when "Culinio" comes into play.

Employees of the company will be able to order and schedule their 3-course meal for a day through the application. They often avoid it to save time rather than waiting in long queues to order their food. When the schedule of an employee is full and piling up, they choose to skip their meal. In these scenarios, the employee will be able to pre-schedule their meals through our application before they get drowned in work. Culinio helps the employees save their time waiting in the long cafeteria queues. The employees schedule their order with just a click and “Culinio” will take care of the rest. Even if the employee forgets to schedule his/her meal for the day, “Culinio” has an option to “Place an order” instantly. The orders will be placed at the scheduled time or instantly to the office cafeteria. When the ordered meal is ready the chef/attendee at the office cafeteria will notify the employee through our application. A notification with an alarm will be sent to the employee who ordered the food. The alarm will remind the employee about his/her meal and this in return ensures that a person doesn’t skip his/her meal.

The employees need not register separately in our application. The organization will register on behalf of all the employees and chefs.  A unique 4 digit code will be generated, which need to be used by the employees and the chefs at the Office Cafeteria to have encrypted communication. The code ensures that the order placed by a particular organization’s employee is received by the same organization’s cafeteria.

## _Advantages_
“Culinio” provides an easy and safe environment to get the food of the employees. It ensures that the employee never forgets his/her meal for the day. As we always say “Time is precious”. So “Culinio” never wastes an employee’s precious time. It reduces the waiting time at the cafeteria. By pre-scheduling the employee never skips their meal but also eats it on time. So they stay fit and healthy. Eating 3 meals per day is no big deal but eating it at the right time matters. So to have his meal at the right time he needs to plan his day in advance. So he also becomes more conscious and organized to get his work in time which will allow him to have his meal at the right time. Overall, this system “Culinio” is best suited and beneficial for a corporate environment and helps the employees to stay fit and healthy.

## _Conclusion_
To put it in a nutshell "Culinio" remembers and reminds the time of a meal that one should take. Now the employees will not feel guilty and forget to have their meal on time. Eating on time keeps the employee healthy and fit which in turn helps him to work more focused and determined towards his company.


# _Description_

## _Introduction_
“Culinio” is an android application that allows the employees of a particular company to pre-schedule and order their meal. To use this application a particular company needs to register in our application. There will be 3 logins separately for the Employees, Chef, and the Organization. When logged into their respective login they will be able to access different views of the application. Right after the organization registration a unique “4 digit code” will be generated for that particular organization. This 4 digit code provides encrypted communication within the organization so that each employee is made sure that his/her order is sent only to his/her company’s cafeteria.

## _Organizational Login_
When a particular organization logs into our application they need to provide the organization's email address and password. 
They will be able to add the menu items of their cafeteria and the chef details who will be handling all the orders in their office cafeteria.
 On the top right corner, the unique 4 digit code generated for this particular organization will be displayed. The code can be copied by clicking it. 
4 categories will be available to upload the menu items. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, and beverages/snacks are the categories available. While entering the menu items they need to provide the name, price, and a short description of that item. They will also upload an image of that item. They can upload the menu items in the respective category. 
They will also be provided an option to edit and delete the particular menu item. By clicking a particular menu item they will be redirected to a page where the option to edit and delete will be available.
They can add the chef details by clicking the button “Chef Details”. While entering the Chef details they will be providing the Chef’s name, email address, and password. They will also be able to delete a particular chef’s details.


## _Grab Scrap_
As this Circularity shouldn’t be limited to one industry we have created an application called GRAB SCRAP where manufacturers and consumers from varied sectors can buy & sell  recyclable waste. They can rely on us to fulfill their respective needs as we provide the gathered information from our users. Industries - Small scale businesses - individuals from varied sectors can register on our App and benefit from the plethora of opportunities to buy or sell recyclable waste. Registration is a one-time procedure where users register with their name, email address and contact number. We only provide a platform for the exchange of goods and do not operate as a middleman between the producer and the consumer, so they do not have to pay any additional fee or commission involved. The producer who desires to sell his recyclable waste will have to furnish the details like cost, address, description, image so that the buyer has a clear picture of what they  are looking to purchase. We do offer 2 add-on features that allow the seller to delete and edit the product details at any time. The buyer will be able to see all the details of the product in a one-click process that includes price, contact information, address and company name. Grab is user friendly and interactive which makes the user’s experience comfortable. In the long run this sector boosts economic growth and also increases job opportunities. For example this sector employs 12 million people in Brazil, China and the United States alone. We hope that through our application we could create a positive impact on the environment through waste recycling and reusing.
